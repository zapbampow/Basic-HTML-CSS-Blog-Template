# basic-html-and-css-blog-template

This is a simple html blog template with minimal styling. It was originally written as a project for Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp course. He showed his final product. I copied the look. Other than a couple of tweaks, the code is all my own.

To use simply copy and paste everything within a div class="post". Then change the content of the date, post title, and paragraphs.
